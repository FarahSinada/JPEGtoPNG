# JPEGtoPNG
JPEG to PNG converter

Take in two arguments; folder name that contains images that are to be converted, and the new folder where the images are to be stored.
If the new folder doesn't exist already, create it. This is where converted images should go.
Then loop through all the jpeg images in the current folder and convert them to png.
